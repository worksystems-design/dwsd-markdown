# Changelog — model & convention decisions

Notable changes to the DWSD model and its Markdown conventions, recorded **from the first
commit onward**. The current model is described by the reference itself — `README.md`,
`conventions.md`, and the pages under `types/`; this log tracks how it changes over time.

- **Work systems are marked on `unit-type`, not by `flightlevel`.** A unit is a work
  system when its `unit-type` includes the reserved value `work-system` (e.g.
  `unit-type: [team, work-system]`). Previously a work system was recognized implicitly by
  the *presence of a `flightlevel`*. `flightlevel` stays — it remains **required** on every
  work system and records the flight level — but it is no longer the discriminator. This
  makes a unit's two hats (a **team** of people and a **work system** in the flow) explicit
  on one field instead of inferred.
- **`<base>-type` discriminators may be lists.** Any discriminator named `<base>-type`
  (`unit-type`, `visualization-type`, `agreement-type`, `interaction-type`) may hold a
  single token or a YAML list, so an entity can declare several kinds at once. In practice
  only `unit-type` uses this today.
